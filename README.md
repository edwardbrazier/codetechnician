# ClaudeCLI



## Overview

Command line interface to Anthropic's Claude AI, oriented around programming.

This is a developer tool. The distinctive feature of this tool is that it can put codebases into the context for Claude, so that Claude can see all of your code when giving advice, writing new code and writing modifications to the code. It supports both a chat interface and a command for sending Claude's output into multiple source files.

ClaudeCLI allows the Claude AI to write large amounts of code when the user enters single instruction: If fulfilling the user's instruction requires writing a dozen or more pages of code across a number of files, then ClaudeCLI will interact with Claude multiple times until it has finished.

The author of this tool is not affiliated in any way with Anthropic, which owns the Claude model.

## How to get an API Key

As of April 2024: To get an API Key to access Claude, go to the Anthropic website and select the 'API' page, which is titled 'Build with Claude'.

## Installation and essential configuration

Before you run ClaudeCLI, put your Anthropic API key into the environment variable ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. 

There are two ways of running this program:
1. From the Windows exe file ./dist/claudecli.exe, which depends on some other files in the repository.
2. From the source code, using Python. (See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))

The supported shells are:
1. Powershell on Windows 11
2. Bash on WSL (Ubuntu)

It is likely that Bash on other Linux flavours will also work.

The Windows Command Prompt is not supported and will not work properly.

### Configuration file

The configuration file *config.yaml* can be found in the default config directory of the user defined by the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

On a Linux/MacOS system it is defined by the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable (check it using `echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). The default, if the variable is not set, should be the `~/.config` folder.

On the first execution of the script, a [template](config.yaml) of the config file is automatically created. If a config file already exists but is missing any fields, default values are used for the missing fields.

## Models

As of May 2024, ClaudeCLI supports all three models in the Claude 3 series: haiku, sonnet and opus.

Haiku is the fastest and cheapest model. Opus is the most capable. Sonnet is in between.

## Basic usage

Here are some usage examples on Windows in Powershell.

Start from a folder which is not your existing project folder.
First you need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Here is a simple, generic example:
```
> git clone https://github.com/edwardbrazier/claudecli.git
> cd claudecli
> cd dist\claudecli
> .\claudecli.exe
>>> What is the capital of New Zealand?
The capital of New Zealand is Wellington.
>>> /q
```

Now a simple programming-oriented example, again starting from the dist/claudecli directory:
```
> .\claudecli.exe -s ..\..\claudecli -e py,txt -m haiku
# (some output has been omitted here for clarity)
>>> Summarise.
This codebase provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Anthropic Claude AI model. It allows users to
provide context from local files or directories, set various options, and engage in a conversational session with the
model. The key features of this codebase include:

 1 Loading and processing a codebase as context for the AI model.
 2 Handling user prompts and generating responses from the AI model.
 3 Saving the AI's output to files, including the concatenated output and any generated code files.
 4 Parsing the AI's XML-formatted responses to extract the generated code and file changes.
 5 Providing a system prompt for the AI to follow specific formatting and style guidelines.
 6 Handling exceptions and errors that may occur during the interaction with the AI model.
 7 Providing configuration options and loading/saving session history.

The codebase is structured into several modules, each with its own responsibilities, such as ai_functions, parseaicode,
printing, load, save, and interact. The main entry point is the __main__.py file, which handles the command-line
interface and coordinates the various components.
>>> /q
```

In the above command, the '-s' parameter specifies the codebase to supply to Claude as context, the '-e' parameter specifies which file extensions to look at in the codebase and '-m' specifies the AI model to use.

Now an example of outputting code from Claude to some files, again starting from the dist/claudecli directory:
```
> mkdir out
> .\claudecli.exe -s ..\..\claudecli -e py,txt -m haiku -o out -csp ..\..\claudecli\coder_system_prompt_default.txt
ClaudeCLI
Model in use: claude-3-haiku-20240307

>>> /q
> ls out

    Directory: [...]\claudecli\out


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         4/05/2024   4:08 PM           9335 ai_functions.py
-a----         4/05/2024   4:08 PM           9611 concatenated_output.txt
```

In this example, ClaudeCLI has sent some code written by Claude to a file called ai_functions.py in the 'out' directory.  
You can then use the diff / merge function in your IDE to compare this new file with your existing source file (..\..\claudecli\ai_functions.py) and merge the differences.

In the command used to call ClaudeCLI, '-o' is the output directory and '-csp' is the system prompt for outputting code to files.
In the command used inside ClaudeCLI, '/o' means to output the results to source files in the output directory (in this case, the folder 'out').

When you supply a codebase to ClaudeCLI, it will always tell you the size of the codebase in kilobytes. This and the choice of model are the main determinants of the cost of each message to Claude. If the codebase is more than a megabyte, then it will not work: This is too big for Claude's context window. Check the codebase size each time to make sure that you have not accidentally included too much code into the context, because this will mean that each message to Claude costs more money (API credits) than you intend. 

Sometimes you need to press Enter an extra time to get ClaudeCLI's result.

When you use '/o' to direct ClaudeCLI to output its response to a code file, ClaudeCLI will also produce a file called concatenated_output.txt in the output directory (in this case ..\..\out). This file has the raw output of Claude. If Claude's output is malformed and can't be divided into separate code files by ClaudeCLI's parser, then you can look at concatenated_output.txt to see whether the raw output of Claude is useful to you.

To get more usage instructions, run:
```
> cd dist\claudecli
> .\claudecli.exe --help
```

## Multiline input

Add the `--multiline` (or `-ml`) flag in order to toggle multi-line input mode. In this mode use `Alt+Enter` or `Esc+Enter` to submit messages.

## Context

The distinctive feature of ClaudeCLI is that it allows you to put entire codebases into the context for the AI.

To provide multiple codebases, use the '-s' option multiple times, like this (Powershell):
```
> .\claudecli.exe -s .\codebase1\src -s .\codebase2\src -e py,txt -m haiku -o .\out -csp ..\..\claudecli\coder_system_prompt_default.txt
```

## Markdown rendering

By default, ClaudeCLI asks Claude for Markdown and renders its output with some formatting.
This can be turned off in the configuration file.
